Ran out of time for PS6. Got a decent gui going but could not get coded UI test correct and did not really comment. Really an extremely subpar job
however I did learn alot about gui and codedui so not all lost. Spent over 15 hours but still ran short so way underestimated time cost. 
Did like my goto cell but should improve it so actually redraws grid

Probably underestimated how long this will take by a little. 
The read xml requires alot of logic to check it for errors. 
Also had to look up the requirements for the lookup function almost did what Excell does and just have it output 
zero if no value can be looked up instead of throwing an argument. 
Also had to change the var regex again.

Assuming that the equals sign will be the first character of the formula string so I can just use the built in 
function in string to look and see if it is.

Find and Replace did not work well with visual studio. Had to put in alot of work rewriting test case code from 
PS4 to make sure I did not break anything. Had 75% code coverage already though when finished so not bad. 
Went on coding up xml and realized I had forgot the using reader and writer so wrote an empty document. 
Was worried till I compared with lecuture example code and saw my mistake.

Worked on getting 100 percent code coverage. Had to write several custom xml docs to test. I was suprised that 
could not write xml in unit test. There probably is a way to mimic them but seemed easier just to create a folder
loaded with them.

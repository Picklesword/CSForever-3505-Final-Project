I was not able to get the UItest to work so I gave up. 
JIm told me to state that for handling circular exceptions and other errors that I could put them in the cell instead of doing a popup.  If this is an issue he said that I could make the change on my code to do so.  My program creates, opens, saves and closes files.  It allows you to add values in the cells using enter or by pushing the button.  The help menu give information on how to run the program.  I created a find method that allows you to find a value and all of the cells that contain it. It also allows you to replace the values in the cells.

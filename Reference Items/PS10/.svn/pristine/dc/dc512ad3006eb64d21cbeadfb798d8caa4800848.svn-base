Hey Scott,
I've just about finished with the WebServer side of things. I'll probably be working on making the webpages themselves look better Friday morning (which shouldn't conflict with your code).

The only thing left is to code the DatabaseManager and thoroughly test everything. All method stubbs for the DatabaseManager that the server calls have been created (both for recording games and retrieving info for the web pages).
If you need to modify the tables in the database, go right ahead, I haven't written any code that depends on a specific structure (all of that would be in the DatabaseManager, of course).

If you have any questions just shoot me a text. If it's a quick answer then I'll text back, otherwise I'll call you as soon as I can.
